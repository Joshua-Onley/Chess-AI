**Overview**

This project is a chess AI built using Python and Pygame. The AI is designed to evaluate board positions and make decisions based on the minimax algorithm.

**Features**
* Play against an AI opponent
* Move generation and validation (no illegal moves can be played)
* Implements castling and en-passant
* Simple graphical user interface using Pygame
* Implements the minimax algorithm and quiescence search
* currently does not support the 50 move draw rule or the threefold repitition rule
